# dlam_assignment
This repository will contain the assignment for the module of "Deep Learning for Audio and Music". The objective is to implement two Deep Neural Network architectures, for two different kind of tasks and try to combine those inferences. I chose to implement a U-Net for Spectrogram denoising and a DenseNet for Environmental Sound Classification.
